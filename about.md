### Misson

MeetAIMate is a non-profit community-run organization for networking, facilitating ideas, and promoting research in Mathematics, Engineering, Business Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. We run public seminar discussions on theoretical analysis and practical applications of state-of-the-art AI practice, facilitate independent research groups, and consulting for business AI solutions. 

### Theory Meets Practice

Our weekly discussion meets on a weekly basis, with the main goal of connecting people interested in artificial intelligence for both research innovations and business implementations. Discussions includes perspective from PhD PhD researchers/ graduate students at University of California Berkeley, University of Texas Austin, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, VIASM, and Hanoi University of Science and Techology on state-of-the-arts practice in Computer Vision and NLP, as well as introspective on business challenges in AI integrations at organizations like VinAI, Viettel, and FPT from insiders. 

### Facilitate original ideas and friendly engagement

While we often have a topic pre-determined before events relating to artificial intelligence research/ practice, the topic is only meant to be a conversation starter. In fact, we have had many interesting conversations in the past which stems from individual perspective. Thus, we try encourage everyone to be open and engaged at our events, and don't be hesitant to raise questions. We also encourage people to contribute to our annual research group blog, so please email us at meetaimate@gmail.com with your professional informations and topic proposal for submission.
