### Misson

Meet AI Mate is a community-run organization for networking, facilitating ideas, and promoting research in Mathematics, Engineering, Business Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. We run public seminar discussing theoretical and practical applications of state-of-the-art AI practice, hosting independent research groups, and consulting for business AI solutions. 

### Theory Meets Practice

Our weekly discussion meets on a weekly basis, with the main goal of connecting people interested in artificial intelligence for both research innovations and business implementations. Discussions includes theoretical perspective from PhD researchers/ graduate students from well-known institution like University of California Berkeley, University of Texas Austin, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, VIASM, and Hanoi University of Science and Techology, as well as introspective on contemporary business challenges in AI integrations at big tech organizations like VinAI, Viettel, and FPT from insiders. 

### Facilitate original ideas and friendly engagement

While we often have a topic pre-determined before events relating to artificial intelligence research/ practice, the topic is only meant to be a conversation starter. In fact, we have had many interesting conversations in the past which stems from individual perspective. We also encourage people to contribute to our annual research group blog, so please email us at meetaimate@gmail.com with your professional informations and topic proposal for submission.
